This is the final project for course IMLV Spring 2023. It mainly focuses on predicting the movie box office by implementing three different models: linear model, decision tree, and random forest. I compared the models from both accuracy and interpretability perspective by using some techniques such as partial dependence plot (PDP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). I hope to find a model with decent accuracy while still maintain some interpretability.
